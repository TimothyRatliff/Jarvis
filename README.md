# Jarvis
Jarvis is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot built using the C# Discord API Wrapper [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)  

As of 11/6/19, I've decided to start from scratch on this project by deleting most of the codebase and creating a new visual studio soltion. Since I didn't maintain Jarvis for about 2 years, a lot of the codebase is out of date with Discord's API. Many of the features/commands will be carried over into the next version (2.0.0!), and improved upon. I'll also be setting up continuos integration/deployment, so no more long downtimes due to me being a broke college student! :)
